Subject: General guidelines
---------------------------
Thank you for agreeing to help our team secure storage for Azure Files and Azure Blob Storage.

We have some general guidelines that you must follow when you perform tasks in Azure.
• When creating objects, use the default settings, unless there are requirements that require different configurations.
• Only create, delete, or modify objects to achieve the stated requirements. Unnecessary changes to the environment may adversely affect your final score.
• If there are multiple approaches to achieving a goal, always choose the approach that requires the least amount of administrative effort.

Thanks,
Chief Technology Officer (CTO)


Subject: Existing environment
-----------------------------
We recently decided to move our organization to Azure.

You will be assisting the storage team to provision and configure storage accounts for the organization.

Here are your credentials to access our Azure resources:
User name:
Password:

You can also find the sign in information in the Instructions tab.

You have been given rights to the rg1lod36860363 resource group. Please create all Azure objects in this resource group.

Thanks,
Network administrator



Subject: Storage for App1
-------------------------
We plan to deploy an Azure App Service web app named App1 that will use Azure Storage to store the images for a product catalog in a blob container. App1 has not been deployed yet.

This is your task:

You need to configure storage to support App1. The solution must meet the following requirements:
• Provision a storage account named app1sa36860363. If an Azure datacenter fails, app1sa36860363 must fail over to a datacenter in the same zone. In the event of a regional failure, app1sa36860363 must fail over to a different region.
• The data in app1sa36860363 must be encrypted by using the app-key key that has been provisioned already and by using a system-assigned managed identity.
• app1sa36860363 requires a blob container named images. The container must allow private access only.
• The App1-Managedld user-assigned managed identity must be able to read blobs in app1sa36860363. App1-Managedld must be prevented from modifying existing blobs or creating new blobs.
• app1sa36860363 requires a file share named share1 that will be used by app1sa36860363 to archive daily reports. The file share must be created in the same storage account used by other App1 data. The file share must minimize costs for data storage.

Thanks,
Application development team



Subject: Storage for App2
-------------------------
We are building a custom application named App2. App2 will be deployed to virtual machines located in VNET1/Subnet1.

This is your task:

You need to configure an Azure Storage account for long-term storage of backup and audit log data of App2. The storage account must meet the following requirements:
• Provision a storage account named app2sa36860363 that uses locally-redundant storage (LRS) and contains two containers named backups and auditlogs.
• Blobs in the backups container must be moved to the least expensive storage tier 90 days after the blobs are created. Blobs in other containers must not be moved.
• Data in the auditlogs container cannot be modified or deleted by any users, including administrators, for 10 years after they are created.
• Blob storage in app2sa36860363 must be accessible by using a private IP address from VNET/Subnet1.

Thanks,
Application development team


Subject: Storage configurations for data and replica
----------------------------------------------------
We have existing storage accounts named data36860363 and replica36860363.

This is your task:

You need to configure the storage accounts to meet the following requirements:
• In data36860363 create a new blob container named container4 that has an encryption scope with infrastructure encryption enabled.
• Configure data36860363/container1 to replicate to replica36860363/container1.
• Configure network security of replica36860363 to ensure that a public host with an IP address of 131.107.4.18 can access replica36860363. Access from Azure virtual networks and other public hosts must be blocked.

Thanks,
Network administrator


Subject: Status - Complete
--------------------------
Thank you for helping our team implement and configure storage for Azure Files and Azure Blob storage.

We look forward to working with you again.
